# Programs Section Background Image

## Image Requirements

Place your programs section background image here as `programs-background.jpg`

### Recommended Specifications:
- **File name**: `programs-background.jpg` (or update CSS if using different name)
- **Dimensions**: 1920x800px or higher for best quality
- **Aspect ratio**: Wide landscape orientation (2.4:1 or similar)
- **File size**: Optimized for web (under 300KB recommended)
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency

### Current Setup:
- Image displays with **10% opacity** for subtle background effect
- Cover sizing fills the entire programs section
- Centered positioning for best visual impact
- Content remains fully readable with low opacity
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

### Image Path:
`/images/programs/programs-background.jpg`

### To Add Your Image:
1. Save your image as `programs-background.jpg` in this folder
2. Or rename your image file and update the CSS path in `css/styles.css` line 378

### Alternative Image Formats:
If using a different format, update this line in `css/styles.css`:
```css
background-image: url('../images/programs/your-image-name.jpg');
```

### Opacity Adjustment:
To change the background opacity, modify line 382 in `css/styles.css`:
```css
opacity: 0.1;  /* Change this value (0.0 to 1.0) */
```

**Suggested Images:**
- Youth engaging in activities
- Community service scenes
- Boxing/sports activities
- Group mentorship moments
- San Diego cityscape/community scenes

The very low opacity (10%) ensures the background enhances without interfering with text readability.
